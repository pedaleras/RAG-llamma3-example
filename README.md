# ü§ñ Local RAG Agent using Llama 3 + LangChain

This project demonstrates a simple **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline running **entirely locally**,
combining **Llama 3** (via Ollama) with **LangChain** and **Hugging Face embeddings**.

The agent is capable of reading and reasoning over web content ‚Äî in this example, an article
by [Lilian Weng](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/) about AI agents ‚Äî and then answering questions
about it.

## üß© Credits

This project is inspired by a [YouTube tutorial from C√≥digo Fonte TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuPKOGdA46Q),
where they created a RAG agent using **ChatGPT and the OpenAI API** and based on research from Lilian Weng‚Äôs
post [LLM-powered Autonomous Agents](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/).

I followed the same concept but did something **different**: this version runs **entirely locally** using **Llama 3 via
Ollama** and **free Hugging Face embeddings**, so no API key or paid plan is needed.

## üß© Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **LangChain** (orchestration)
- **Ollama** (to run the Llama 3 model locally)
- **Chroma** (vector database for document retrieval)
- **Hugging Face embeddings** (`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
- **BeautifulSoup4** (HTML parsing for web content)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

1. **Install Ollama**  
   üëâ [https://ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download)

   Then pull the model:
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3
   ```

2. **Clone this repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
    cd <repo-name>/src
    ```

3. **Create and activate a virtual environment**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\activate # Windows
    source .venv/bin/activate # Linux/Mac
    ```

4. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
